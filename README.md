### Vibe Coding
Vibe coding is a buzzy approach to development that emphasizes speed, creativity, and momentumâ€”focusing on the "vibe" (energy/feel) of the product over premature perfection. Itâ€™s about shipping fast, iterating based on feedback, and using modern tools (like React, Tailwind, or low-code platforms) to turn ideas into demos in hours/days instead of weeks.
This entire demo was autonomously generated by AI based solely on initial promptsâ€”without any manual coding or design input from me. Delivering a functional prototype in just one hour demonstrates how AI can be both an incredibly powerful tool for rapid development and a potentially disruptive force, raising questions about the future of creative and technical work.


### Business Idea
Digital Billboards Marketplace - Egypt
Purpose:
This platform democratizes access to Egypt's digital billboards by enabling small/local businesses to advertise affordably. Unlike traditional billboards (expensive & long-term), our solution allows businesses to rent minutes/hours on digital screens across Egyptâ€”similar to Times Square's modelâ€”making high-visibility advertising accessible to all budgets.
