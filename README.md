### Vibe Coding
Vibe coding is a relaxed, AI-driven approach to programming where you rely heavily on tools like large language models (e.g., Cursor Composer with Sonnet) and voice interfaces (like SuperWhisper) to build projects without deeply engaging with the code itself. Instead of writing code manually or understanding the entire codebase, you casually describe changes in natural language (e.g., ‚Äúdecrease the padding on the sidebar by half‚Äù), accept all AI-generated edits without reviewing diffs, and resolve errors by copy-pasting them back into the model. Bugs are often handled by asking for random fixes or simply working around them, making it perfect for throwaway or experimental projects. It‚Äôs less about control and precision, and more about flowing with the vibes ‚Äî seeing stuff, saying stuff, running stuff, and letting the AI make it work.

### Business Idea
Digital Billboards Marketplace - Egypt
Purpose:
This platform democratizes access to Egypt's digital billboards by enabling small/local businesses to advertise affordably. Unlike traditional billboards (expensive & long-term), our solution allows businesses to rent minutes/hours on digital screens across Egypt‚Äîsimilar to Times Square's model‚Äîmaking high-visibility advertising accessible to all budgets.
